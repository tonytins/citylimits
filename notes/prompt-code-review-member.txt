For each function, variable, constant, method, class, or whatever:
If there is no doxygen comment, then create a new one concisely summarizing and (if a function) defining all the parameters and return values. 
If there is an existing comment, then update it with a concise summary, but keep any useful information already in the comment, integrating it in with your own comments.
Keep any todos or bugs or other doxygen comments.
The summary should be formatted as a C++ doxygen comment.
Break lines at 72 characters.
Example:
/**
 * Deduct \a dollars from the player funds.
 * @param dollars Amount of money spent.
 */
void Micropolis::spend(int dollars)
{
    setFunds(totalFunds - dollars);
}
Write the output as a compact diff patch that I can apply to the source code, which only includes insertions and deletions with minimal context.
This prompt will be followed by the entire file. Process the whole file chunk by chunk, as much as you can at a time.
